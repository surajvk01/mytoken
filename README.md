# My Token

This Solidity program serves as a straightforward tool for generating your custom token while offering basic functions like minting and burning. It showcases the essential structure and capabilities of the Solidity programming language. The main aim of this program is to help newcomers to Solidity grasp its foundational concepts.

## Description

This is a basic contract coded in Solidity, a programming language designed for creating smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract includes two functions: "mint," which generates tokens for a particular user, and "burn," which eliminates tokens for the user carrying out this operation.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., mytoken.sol). Copy and paste the code from [mytoken](mytoken.sol)

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile mytoken.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "MyToken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the different functions present in it.
